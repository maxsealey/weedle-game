The plan for this project is to make a publicly accessible SPA where a daily Pokemon is selected randomly, and the user has a given number of tries to determine which is the correct one. Think Wordle, although another lesser known offshoot called Weddle (NFL players), is a more apt comparison.

The game starts with the user selecting one of the 1000+ available Pokemon. The game will then indicate whether the selcted Pokemon has any traits in common with the correct answer, and in some cases will hint at whether they are "hot or cold".
